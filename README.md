# Is Java 8 faster?

Project to compare Java 8 new functionalities vs. old java

This is a one class project to compare execution time of different ways to solve a problem. The problem is to find the most used word in a text. I show different ways to solve using Java 8 new funcionalities and different ways to solve without Java 8 facilities. Just run the main method and find out wich solution is faster. Is Java 8 faster?
